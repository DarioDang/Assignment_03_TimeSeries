## Question 01

```{r}
# Read the time series data
data <- read.csv("A3Data.csv")
```

### A. Show a time series plot and comment on the features

#### 1. Plot for Series A

```{r}
series_a <- ggplot(data, aes(x = 1:nrow(data), y = Series.A)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Time Series Plot for Series A") +
  xlab("Index") +
  ylab("Values") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16))

# show the result 
series_a
```

Comment on the features:

When we first look at the time series plot for `Series A`, we see that it moves up and down in a repeating pattern, indicating some kind of cyclical behavior. The size of the ups and downs (amplitude) changes over time, becoming larger and smaller at different points. There's no clear trend going up or down overall; it seems to fluctuate around zero. The changes in the series happen quite frequently, showing high variability in a short period of time. The highest value is just over 5, and the lowest value is around -5.

#### 2. Plot for Series B

```{r}
# Plot for Series B
series_b <- ggplot(data, aes(x = 1:nrow(data), y = Series.B)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Time Series Plot for Series B") +
  xlab("Index") +
  ylab("Values") + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust =0.5, size = 16))

# show the plot
series_b
```

Comment on the features:

The time series plot for `Series B` shows a similar oscillating pattern to `Series A`, with values moving above and below zero. However, the fluctuations in `Series B` seem less regular and more erratic. The amplitude of the series still varies over time, with some larger spikes and dips occurring occasionally, but overall the series does not show a consistent increasing or decreasing trend. The oscillations appear random in size and timing, indicating high variability. The series takes on values within a range of approximately $\pm 3$.

#### 3. Plot for Series C

```{r}
# Plot for Series C
series_c <-  ggplot(data, aes(x = 1:nrow(data), y = Series.C)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Time Series Plot for Series C") +
  xlab("Index") +
  ylab("Values") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16))

# show the result 
series_c
```

Comment on the features:

The time series plot for `Series C` displays a similar oscillating pattern as seen in the previous series, but with more pronounced fluctuations. The values oscillate around zero, with some noticeable larger spikes and dips. One feature that stands out is the large dip towards the right side of the plot (index $\approx 210$), which indicates an outlier or a significant drop in the values. The amplitude of the oscillations is not constant, varying throughout the plot. There doesnâ€™t appear to be any clear increasing or decreasing trend over time, and the oscillations seem irregular, suggesting random variability with occasional extreme values. Further investigation could help determine whether the extreme values represent anomalies or are part of a natural pattern.

#### 4. Plot for Series D

```{r}
# Plot for Series D
series_d <- ggplot(data, aes(x = 1:nrow(data), y = Series.D)) +
  geom_line() +
  ggtitle("Time Series Plot for Series D") +
  xlab("Index") +
  ylab("Values") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16))

# show the result 
series_d
```

Comment on the features:

The time series plot for `Series D` shows an oscillating pattern similar to the previous series, with values for the most part fluctuating around zero. One notable feature is that the amplitude of the oscillations varies over time, with more prominent peaks and troughs towards the middle and end of the plot. The series does not exhibit any clear upward or downward trend and remains centered around zero, indicating it may be stationary. The fluctuations appear somewhat more irregular than in some of the other series, with no consistent pattern in the timing of the peaks and troughs. There is a slight tendency for larger downward fluctuations towards the end of the series.

### B. Use the PACF to identify AR model, illustrate the reasons of your choice and evaluate the goodness of your model through the `tsdiag` function

**Ljung-Box Test Interpretation:**

**If the point above the line:** We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

**If the point below the line:** We reject the null hypothesis, indicating that there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals at these lag.

#### 1. Checking data stationary

First, before we plot the PACF to identify the AR model, we have to check the stationary of each series.

Therefore, we will check the stationary of each dataset using Augmented Dickey-Fuller `ADF` test:

```{r}
# Check stationarity using Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test
suppressWarnings(adf.test(data$Series.A))
suppressWarnings(adf.test(data$Series.B))
suppressWarnings(adf.test(data$Series.C))
suppressWarnings(adf.test(data$Series.D))
```

Assuming that the standard threshold of 0.05 is used, the p-values are below this threshold. This means that we may be justified in considering these series stationary. Therefore, we can perform the PACF.

#### 2. PACF for Series A

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series A
pacf(data$Series.A, main = "PACF of Series A")
```

Comment: According to the PACF plot for Series A, the partial autocorrelations at lags 1, 2, and 4 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. The PACF values sharply decrease after lag 4, indicating that the PACF cuts off at this point. Therefore, an AR(4) model may be appropriate for this series, as it suggests that the data has significant autocorrelation up to the fourth lag. Alternatively, an AR(1) or AR(2) model may also be a good fit.

```{r}
# Fit the AR(4) model to time series
ar_series_A <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(4, 0, 0))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ar_series_A)
```

**Standardized Residuals**: This plot display residuals that fluctuate randomly around zero with no obvious patterns or trends. In our model, the residuals appear to fluctuate randomly around zero, with no significant patterns, trends, or autocorrelation evident. Overall, the residuals are well-behaved which suggests that the AR(4) model is capturing most of the structure of time series data. It is possible that AR(1), AR(2), or AR(3) could also work.

**ACF of Residuals:** The autocorrelation of residuals shows no significant spikes, as all lags fall within the confidence bounds. This is a good sign, indicating that the residuals do not have significant autocorrelation and are close to white noise. It means the model has adequately captured the time-dependent structure of the series.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above the 0.05 threshold for all lags. We fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

#### 3. PACF for Series B

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series A
pacf(data$Series.B, main = "PACF of Series B")
```

**Comment**: According to the PACF plot for Series B, the partial autocorrelations at lags 1, 2, 3 and 4 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. The PACF values decrease after lag 4, indicating that the PACF cuts off at this point. Therefore, an AR(4) model may be appropriate for this series.

```{r}
# Fit the AR(4) model to time series B
ar_series_B <- Arima(data$Series.B, order = c(4, 0, 0))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ar_series_B)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals appear random, with fluctuations around zero. There are no clear patterns, trends, which indicates that the AR(4) model has captured much of the structure of the time series.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant spikes beyond the first lag, with all values falling within the confidence bounds. This means that the residuals have no autocorrelation, which suggests the model is appropriately capturing the underlying process.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are above 0.05. This indicates we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

#### 4. PACF for Series C

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series C
pacf(data$Series.C, main = "PACF of Series C")
```

**Comment:** According to the PACF plot for Series C, the partial autocorrelations at lags 1, 2, 3, and 4 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. While there are marginally under-significant values at lags 7, 12, and 17. However these may be due to noise or randomness rather than meaningful patterns. The PACF shows a general decrease after lag 4, which suggests that an AR(4) model could capture the main structure of the data without making the model overly complex. Therefore, we choose an AR(4) model as it provides a balance between model complexity and fit, with the main cut-off occurring at lag 4.

```{r}
# Fit the AR(4) model to time series C
ar_series_C <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(4, 0, 0))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ar_series_C)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals appear to fluctuate randomly around zero, with no clear trends or patterns. Based on the plot, there are few larger spike after time 200, but overall, the residuals are well behaved suggesting that the AR(4) model can captured the main structure of the series.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant spikes beyond the first lag, with all values falling within the confidence bounds. This indicates that the residuals are not correlated, which is a good sign that the model has appropriately captured the autocorrelations in the data.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

#### 5. PACF for Series D

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series D
pacf(data$Series.D, main = "PACF of Series D")
```

Comment: According to the PACF plot for Series D, the partial autocorrelations at lags 1, 2, 3, and 6 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. There is a marginally significant value at lag 19, which may be due to noise or randomness. The PACF shows a general decrease after lag 6, which suggests that an AR(6) model could capture the main structure of the data without making the model overly complex. Therefore, we choose an AR(6) model.

```{r}
# Fit the AR(4) model to time series C
ar_series_D <- Arima(data$Series.D, order = c(6, 0, 0))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ar_series_D)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals appear to fluctuate randomly around zero, which is a good sign. There are no clear trends or patterns, indicating that the AR(6) model has adequately captured the structure of the time series. Based on the plot, there are few large spike at the end of plot but they do not indicate any systemic issues to the model.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot of residuals shows no significant autocorrelation with all values falling within the confidence bounds. Hence, the residuals do no exhibit any autocorrelation, it suggests that there are no information left in the residuals that the model has not accounted for.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above the 0.05 threshold. As a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

### C. Use the ACF to identify MA model, illustrate the reasons of your choice and evaluate the goodness of your model through the `tsdiag` function

#### 1. ACF for Series A

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series A
acf(data$Series.A, main = "ACF of Series A")
```

Based on the ACF plot for Series A, the autocorrelations at lags 1 to 8 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. After lag 8, the ACF values drop close to zero, suggesting that the autocorrelations are no longer significant. This cut-off behaviour after lag 8 indicates that an MA(8) model could be appropriate for this series, as the moving average process is likely to extend up to 8 lags. Alternatively, this tailing off behaviour could indicate it is better modelled by an AR process, so an MA(0) may even be appropriate.

```{r}
# Fit the MA(8) model to time series A
ma_series_A <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(0, 0, 8))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ma_series_A)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign. The model appears to have captured the key features of the time series as the residuals bahave like white noise. Hence, the MA(8) model has successfully captured the volatility in the data.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations as all values fall within the confidence bounds. This suggest that the residuals do not exhibit autocorrelation where model has successfully captured the autocorrelations in the data.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags. This confirm we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

Based on the diagnostic check, the MA(8) model seems to be a good fit for Series A. It is almost "too good" and there is a chance it is overfitting the data.

#### 2. ACF for Series B

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series B
acf(data$Series.B, main = "ACF of Series B")
```

Based on the ACF plot or series B, the autocorrelations at lags 1 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. The ACF cut off at lag 1 indicates no further significant value until lag 8, however, these may be due to noise or randomness. Hence, The sharp cut-off in the ACF at lag 1 suggests that an MA(1) model could adequately capture the main structure of the data without adding unnecessary complexity. Therefore, an MA(1) model might appropriate for this series.

```{r}
# Fit the MA(1) model to time series B
ma_series_B <- Arima(data$Series.B, order = c(0, 0, 1))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ma_series_B)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero, with no obvious patterns or trends. This indicates the the MA(1) model has captured the main structure of the time series.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations as all values fall within the confidence bounds. The absence of significant spikes confirms that there is no remaining autocorrelation in the residuals, which means that the model has effectively captured the temporal structure of the data.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags, which indicates we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

Based on the diagnostic check, the MA(1) model seems to be a good fit for Series B.

#### 3. ACF for Series C

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series C
acf(data$Series.C, main = "ACF of Series C")
```

Comment: There is a significant spike at lag 1 that exceeds the confidence bounds, indicating that there is strong autocorrelation at this lag. After lag 1, the autocorrelation values quickly diminish, with subsequent lags mostly within the confidence bounds. The small and insignificant autocorrelation values at lag 8 and lag 13, suggest that there might be some white noise. Hence, the ACF shows a sharp cut - off at lag 1, this suggest the MA(1) is likely appropriate. There is also a cyclical pattern in the ACF.

```{r}
# Fit the MA(2) model to time series D
ma_series_C <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(0, 0, 1))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ma_series_C)
```

**Standardized Residuals:**

**ACF of Residuals:** The autocorrelation values are mostly within the confidence bounds. This suggests that most of the autocorrelation has been captured by the model.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values are all above the 0.05 threshold for all lags, there are a few lags show slightly lower p-values (closer to the 0.05 mark), but they are still above the threshold. As a result, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

Based on the diagnostic check, the MA(1) model seems to be a good fit for Series C.

#### 4. ACF for Series D

```{r}
# Plot PACF for Series D
acf(data$Series.D, main = "ACF of Series D")
```

Comment: According to the ACF plot for time series D, the autocorrelations at lags 1 and 2 are significantly different from zero at the 5% significance level. After lag 2, the ACF values drops close to zero, indicating no significant autocorrelation at further lags. While there are some minor spikes at lags 6, 17, and 18, barely above or just under the lines of significance, these are likely some autocorrelation pattern in these lags need to further investigate. The sharp cut-off in the ACF after lag 2 suggests that an MA(2) model is appropriate for this series, as it can capture the main structure of the data.

```{r}
# Fit the MA(2) model to time series D
ma_series_D <- Arima(data$Series.D, order = c(0, 0, 2))

# Perform diagnostics using tsdiag
tsdiag(ma_series_D)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero, there are a few spikes in the residuals between time 100 and 150 but they do not follow any consistent pattern this indicate no clear patterns or trends (random). Hence, this indicates that the MA(2) model has adequately captured the structure of the time series

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations remaining, as all values fall within the confidence bounds. While there are small spikes at lags 6 and 18, these values remain within the confidence limits and likely result from random fluctuations or noise. They are unlikely to affect the model significantly but are worth noting for potential further investigation.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values are mostly above the 0.05 threshold for all lags, there are a few lags show slightly lower p-values (closer to the 0.05 mark), but they are still above the threshold. This indicate model capture all the autocorrelation and the spikes at lag 6 and 18 is some random noise. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

Based on the diagnostic check, the MA(2) model seems to be a good fit for Series D.

## Question 02

### A. Identify ARMA Series A

#### A.1 Try with ARMA(1,0) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(1)
arma_100_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(1, 0, 0))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_100_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals appear to fluctuate around zero, which is generally what we expect from a well-fitted model.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations remaining, as all values fall within the confidence bounds. While there are small spikes at lags 2, 3 and 9, these values remain within the confidence limits and likely result from random noise.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** According to the p values for Lijung - Box statistic, most of p-values at certain lags (1,3,5,7,9,10) fall below the 0.05 significant level. This means that we reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, indicating that there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals at these lags.

As a result, ARMA(1,0,0) may not fully capture the underlying autocorrelation structure of the time series indicate this is not a best fit model for this series.

#### A.2 Try with ARMA(2,0) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(2,0,0)
arma_200_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(2, 0, 0))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_200_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals appear to fluctuate around zero, which is generally what we expect from a well-fitted model.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations remaining, as all values fall within the confidence bounds. While there are small spikes at lags 9 that might be some autocorrelation there which the model did not capture.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** According to the p values for Lijung - Box statistic, all of p-value above the 0.05 significant level. This mean we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals. However, there is a noticeable at the p -value at lag 9 is just slightly above the significant level, it might be useful to further investigate or might fit the model include lag 9 to compare the result.

As a result, this model might fit well to the data but some notice at lag 9 might be need to further investigate.

#### A.3 Try with ARMA(1,1) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(1)
arma_101_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(1, 0, 1))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_101_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals are centered around zero with no visible patterns, which indicates that the ARMA(1,0,1) model has effectively captured the major structure of the data.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations remaining, as all values fall within the confidence bounds. While there are small spikes at lags 9 that might be some autocorrelation there which the model did not capture.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p - values at lag 9 is lay on the significant bound. Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, indicating that there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals at this lag.

Therefore, ARMA(1,0,1) is not an adequate model for this time series since not capture all pattern of data.

#### A.4 Try with ARMA(1,2) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(1,0,2)
arma_102_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(1, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_102_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals are centered around zero with no visible patterns, which indicates that the ARMA(1,0,1) model has effectively captured the major structure of the data.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations remaining, as all values fall within the confidence bounds. While there are small spikes at lags 9 which likely result from random noise.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags, which indicates that there is no significant autocorrelation remaining in the residuals. It suggest we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

Therefore, ARMA(1,0,2) is represented as an adequate model for this series.

#### A.5 Try with ARMA(0,1) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(0,0,1)
arma_001_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(0, 0, 1))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_001_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals are centered around zero with no visible patterns, look like the good sign of the model fit well.

**ACF of Residuals:** however, there is a noticeable spike at lags 1 to 5 that falls outside the confidence bounds, indicating there are some autocorrelation in the residuals where the model cannot capture.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** all the p-values are below 0.05 indicates that we reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals at these lags.

The ARMA(0,0,1) model is not a good fit for this time series, as there is still significant autocorrelation in the residuals which the model cannot capture.

#### A.6 Try with ARMA(0,2) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(0,0,2)
arma_002_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(0, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_002_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** the residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign indicate that model has captured some structure of data. However, the variability appears relatively consistent which suggest that the model may no have fully captured all underlying dynamic data.

**ACF of Residuals:** there is a noticeable spike at lags 1, 2, 3 and 5 that falls outside the confidence bounds, indicating that some autocorrelation remains in the residuals.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** all the p-values are below 0.05 indicates that we reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals at these lags.

The ARMA(0,0,2) model is not a good fit for this time series, as there is still significant autocorrelation in the residuals which the model cannot capture.

#### A.7 Try with ARMA(2,1) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(2,0,1)
arma_201_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(2, 0, 1))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_201_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign indicate that model has captured structure of data.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations remaining, as all values fall within the confidence bounds. However, there are small spikes at lags 9 indicate the model not fully capture all autocorrelation

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags, Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

This suggest that the ARMA(2,0,1) is an adequate model for this series but the p values at lag 9 just slightly above the line, hence, ARMA(2,0,2) might get a better result in this case.

#### A.8 Try with ARMA(2,2) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with AR(2,0,1)
arma_202_model_seriesA <- Arima(data$Series.A, order = c(2, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_202_model_seriesA)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign indicate that model has captured structure of data.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations as all values fall within the confidence bounds. The reduction in autocorrelation at lag 9 compared to the previous model suggests that the current model captures more of the temporal structure in the data.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags, which indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

As a result, ARMA(2,0,2) seem to be an adequate model for this series.

#### A.9 Try with Auto ARIMA

```{r}
# Compare with auto.arima
auto_arima_seriesA <- auto.arima(data$Series.A)

# show the result 
auto_arima_seriesA
```

#### Model Selection

```{r}
# Compare the AIC from each model 
aic_arma100_seriesA <- arma_100_model_seriesA$aic 
aic_arma200_seriesA <- arma_200_model_seriesA$aic 
aic_arma101_seriesA <- arma_101_model_seriesA$aic
aic_arma102_seriesA <- arma_102_model_seriesA$aic
aic_arma001_seriesA <- arma_001_model_seriesA$aic
aic_arma002_seriesA <- arma_002_model_seriesA$aic
aic_arma201_seriesA <- arma_201_model_seriesA$aic
aic_arma202_seriesA <- arma_202_model_seriesA$aic
```

```{r}

We used AIC to compared different ARIMA model, based on the table ARIMA(2,0,2) have the lowest AIC and based on the tsdiag shown below, the model has captured all of the autocorrelation pattern and leave the white noise on the residual. Hence, it perform as an adequate model for this particular time series.

In order to interpret the model we extract the coefficient of the ARMA(2.0,2)

```{r}
# Extract the coefficient of ARMA(2,0,2)
summary(arma_202_model_seriesA)
```

The ARMA(2,0,2) model for the time series indicates that the current value is influenced by both past values and past forecast errors. The AR(1) (-1.6181) and AR(2) (-0.6846) terms suggest an inverse relationship with the values at lag 1 and lag 2, meaning that if the previous values were high, the current value is likely to be lower. The MA(1) (0.8915) and MA(2) (0.2601) terms show that errors from the previous two periods positively affect the current value, with a stronger impact from the most recent error. The model effectively balances these influences, and with low AIC (719.21) and RMSE (1.0527) values, it fits the data well.

### B. Identify ARMA Series B

Since we have define the AR(4) and MA(1) is suitable for this time series as above now we test with the combination of AR and MA to see whether it perform a better fit. Since the AR(4) is out of the range of p and q (0,1,2). Therefore, we can try the MA(2) to see whether it have better performance.

#### B.1 Try with ARMA(0,2) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(1,0,1)
arma_002_model_seriesB <- Arima(data$Series.B, order = c(0, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_002_model_seriesB)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign indicate that model has captured structure of data.

**ACF of Residuals:** The ACF plot shows no significant autocorrelations as most of all values fall within the confidence bounds indicate that there is no autocorrelation in the residual just only white noise.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values for the Ljung-Box test are consistently above 0.05 for all lags, which indicates that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals. Moreover, the p - values are also higher than the MA(1) that we defined in the first question

As a result, ARMA(0,0,2) seem to be an adequate model for this time series.

Let look at the combination of AR and MA

#### B.1 Try with ARMA(1,1) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(1,0,1)

#### B.3 Try with ARMA(2,1) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(1,0,1)
arma_201_model_seriesB <- Arima(data$Series.B, order = c(2, 0, 1))

#### B.4 Try with ARMA(2,2) model

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(2,0,2)
arma_202_model_seriesB <- Arima(data$Series.B, order = c(2, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model

```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign indicate that model has captured structure of data.

As a result, ARMA(2,0,1) seem to be an adequate model for this series.

#### B.5 Auto Arima For Comparison

```{r}
# Compare with auto.arima
auto_arima_seriesB <- auto.arima(data$Series.B)

# show the result 
auto_arima_seriesB
```

```{r}
# Compare the AIC from each model 
aic_arma400_seriesB <- ar_series_B$aic
aic_arma001_seriesB <- ma_series_B$aic

aic_arma102_seriesB <- arma_102_model_seriesB$aic
aic_arma201_seriesB <- arma_201_model_seriesB$aic
aic_arma202_seriesB <- arma_202_model_seriesB$aic
aic_auto_arima_seriesB <- auto_arima_seriesB$aic
```

```{r}
# Create a data frame for the AIC values
series_B_aic_values <- data.frame(
  Model = c("ARMA(4,0,0)","ARMA(0,0,1)","ARMA(1,0,1)", "ARMA(1,0,2)", "ARMA(2,0,1)", "ARMA(2,0,2)", "Auto_Arima(0,0,2)"),
  AIC = c(aic_arma400_seriesB,aic_arma001_seriesB,aic_arma101_seriesB, aic_arma102_seriesB, aic_arma201_seriesB,
           aic_arma202_seriesB, aic_auto_arima_seriesB)
)

series_B_aic_values %>%
  kable("html", caption = "Model Comparison") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                full_width = F, position = "center")
```

#### Model Selection

Similar to Series A,, we used AIC to compared different ARIMA model. Based on the table ARIMA(0,0,2) have the lowest AIC which was also chosen by the Auto Arima. The ARMA(0,0,2) tsdiag also shown the model has captured all of the autocorrelation with the very high Ljung - Box test p-value . Therefore, we choose ARMA(0,0,2) as an adequate model for this time series.

In order to interpret the model more detail we extract the coefficient of the ARMA(0,0,2)

```{r}
# Extract the coefficient of ARMA(0,0,2) model 
summary(arma_002_model_seriesB)
```

The ARMA(0,0,2) model for series B indicates that the current value is influenced by the errors from the previous two periods. The MA1 coefficient (0.5061) shows a moderate positive impact from the error at lag 1, meaning that a positive error in the previous step increases the current value. The MA2 coefficient (-0.0997) indicates a weaker, slightly negative influence from the error at lag 2, but its effect is minimal. The small positive mean (0.0613) suggests the series fluctuates around a slightly positive level. With low AIC (682.75) and RMSE (0.9861), the model appears to fit the data well, capturing the key dynamics of the time series effectively.

### C. Identify a suitable ARMA for Series C

From question 1 we have identified that an AR(4)/MA(1) model could be suitable for this time series. Let's start with an MA(1) = ARMA(0,1) model and make successive adjustments by modeling the residuals.

#### C.1 ARMA(0,1)

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(0,1)
arma_01_model_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(0, 0, 1))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_01_model_seriesC)
```

The residuals appear to be white noise, although there might be a slight cyclical pattern. The ACF shows only significance for lag 8 (likely due to noise), and the Ljung-Box statistic is above the line of significance for all lags. This suggests that the residuals are likely white noise, thus an ARMA(0,1) model appears to be a good fit. Let's try plotting a PACF of the residuals to see if adding an AR component could be beneficial.


```{r}
pacf(arma_01_model_seriesC$residuals)
```

The PACF of the residuals shows a lag very close to the line of significance at lag = 8.  However, given we are limited to p = 0, 1, and 2 the purposes of the assignment, it does not appear that adding an AR component with these low p values would benefit the model.

As adding an AR component does not appear beneficial, Let's now try subtracting one from the MA component to make an ARMA(0,0) white noise model to see if it will still lead to a good fit.

#### C.2 ARMA(0,0)

```{r}
# Fit the model with ARMA(0,0)
arma_00_model_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(0, 0, 0))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_00_model_seriesC)
```

The ACF plot shows significance at lag 1 indicating the original ARMA(0,1) model was the right choice. Furthermore, all the p-values for the Ljung-Box statistic are below 0, which means that we can reject the null hypothesis that there is no significant autocorrelation for the residuals for these lags. This all suggests that the ARMA(0,0) white noise model is a poor one for this time series. The original ARMA(0,1) model is a better fit. 

Considering the residuals for ARMA(0,1) already approximate white noise fairly well. Increasing the MA component by one to an ARMA(0,2) model may lead to overfitting. By being parsimonious, it is better to keep the simpler ARMA(0,1) model.

Let's now compare ARMA(0,1) with the one provided by `auto.arima()`.

#### C.5 Try Auto Arima for series C

```{r}
# Compare with auto.arima
auto_arima_seriesC <- auto.arima(data$Series.C)

# show the result 
auto_arima_seriesC
```

`auto.arima()` provides an ARMA(2,4) model. It has a relatively low AIC of 703.6.

```{r}
tsdiag(auto_arima_seriesC)
```

All the tsdiag outputs suggest that the residuals of ARMA(2,4) are a white noise process. The ACF of the residuals are within the lines of significance, and the p values of the Ljung-Box statistic are above the lines of significance.

The ARMA(2,4) model is arguably a better fit, however it is more complicated than the ARMA(0,1) model and depending on the purposes of the modeling, either model could be used.

#### Model Selection

Lastly, let's compare AICs of all the possible models with $0 \leq p \leq 3$ and $0 \leq q \leq 3$ as another method to determine whether ARMA(0,1) was ultimately a good fit.

```{r}
# Compare the AIC from each model 
aic_arma00_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(0, 0, 0))$aic
aic_arma01_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(0, 0, 1))$aic
aic_arma10_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(1, 0, 0))$aic
aic_arma02_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(0, 0, 2))$aic
aic_arma20_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(2, 0, 0))$aic
aic_arma11_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(1, 0, 1))$aic
aic_arma12_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(1, 0, 2))$aic
aic_arma21_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(2, 0, 1))$aic
aic_arma22_seriesC <- Arima(data$Series.C, order = c(2, 0, 2))$aic
aic_auto_arima_seriesC <- auto_arima_seriesC$aic
```

```{r}
# Create a data frame for the AIC values
series_C_aic_values <- data.frame(
  Model = c("ARMA(0,0)","ARMA(0,1)", "ARMA(1,0)", "ARMA(0,2)", "ARMA(2, 0)", "ARMA(1,1)", "ARMA(1,2)", "ARMA(2,1)", "ARMA(2,2)", "Auto_Arima"),
  AIC = c(aic_arma00_seriesC,aic_arma01_seriesC,aic_arma10_seriesC,aic_arma02_seriesC,aic_arma20_seriesC,aic_arma11_seriesC, aic_arma12_seriesC, aic_arma21_seriesC,
           aic_arma22_seriesC, aic_auto_arima_seriesC)
)

# Use kableExtra to create a formatted table
series_C_aic_values %>%
  kable("html", caption = "Model Comparison") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"),
                full_width = F, position = "center")
```

Excluding Auto_Arima, ARMA(0,1) had the third lowest AIC. Surprisingly, ARMA(0,2) and ARMA(1,1) had better AIC terms.

### D. Identify ARMA Series D

**TODO**

#### D.1 Try with ARMA(1,1)

```{r}
# Fit the model with MA(2)
arma_101_model_seriesD <- Arima(data$Series.D, order = c(1, 0, 1))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_101_model_seriesD)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** the residuals fluctuate randomly around zero with no clear patterns or trends which is a good sign indicate that model has captured some structure of data.

**ACF of Residuals:** However, there is a noticeable spike at lags 6 and lag 18 that falls outside the confidence bounds, indicating that some autocorrelation remains in the residuals.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** only the p-values at lag 1,2 and 4 are below 0.05, indicates that we reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, there is significant autocorrelation in the residuals at these lags.

The ARMA(1,0,1) model is not a good fit for this time series, as there is still significant autocorrelation in the residuals which the model cannot capture.

#### D.2 Try with ARMA(1,2)

```{r}
# Fit the model with MA(2)
arma_102_model_seriesD <- Arima(data$Series.D, order = c(1, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_102_model_seriesD)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero, there are a few spikes in the residuals between time 100 and 150 but they do not follow any consistent pattern this indicate no clear patterns or trends (random).

**ACF of Residuals:** there is a noticeable spike at lags 6 and lag 18 that falls outside the confidence bounds, indicating that some autocorrelation remains in the residuals.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** however, the p-values at all lags now above 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals. And lag 6 might be some white noise.

#### D.3 Try with ARMA(2,1)

```{r}
# Fit the model with MA(2)
arma_201_model_seriesD <- Arima(data$Series.D, order = c(2, 0, 1))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_201_model_seriesD)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero, there are a few spikes in the residuals between time 100 and 150 but they do not follow any consistent pattern this indicate no clear patterns or trends (random).

**ACF of Residuals:** the noticeable spike at lags 6 and lag 18 are now fall below the significant line, indicating ARMA(2,0,1) has captured the autocorrelation at these certain lags compare to the previous one.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values at all lags now above 0.05. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

#### D.4 Try with ARMA(2,2)

```{r}
# Fit the model with MA(2)
arma_202_model_seriesD <- Arima(data$Series.D, order = c(2, 0, 2))

# Evaluate the model 
tsdiag(arma_202_model_seriesD)
```

**Standardized Residuals:** The residuals fluctuate randomly around zero, there are a few spikes in the residuals between time 100 and 150 but they do not follow any consistent pattern this indicate no clear patterns or trends (random).

**ACF of Residuals:** similar to ARMA(2,0,1) the noticeable spike at lags 6 and lag 18 are now fall below the significant line, this mean the model has captured the autocorrelation at these certain lags.

**Ljung - Box p - values:** The p-values at all lags now above 0.05 especially very high for the first few lags. Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation in the residuals.

#### D.5 Try Auto Arima For Comparison

```{r}
# Compare with auto.arima
auto_arima_seriesD <- auto.arima(data$Series.D)

# show the result 
auto_arima_seriesD

## Question 03

### Extracting Time Series and plotting it

Use the library quantmod to extract the daily time series of the share prices of the Burberry Group by using the command `getSymbols("BB2.BE",from="2015-01-01",to="2024-08-31")`, extract the adjusted price and plot it.

```{r}
library(quantmod)
library(forecast)
```

Two series `bb2_adjusted` will be extracted. It will then be differenced to form `bb2_adjusted_diff`.

```{r}
getSymbols("BB2.BE",from="2015-01-01",to="2024-08-31")

bb2_adjusted <- BB2.BE$BB2.BE.Adjusted
```

```{r}
plot(bb2_adjusted)
```

### Part A

::: boxTask
Give a brief explanation of the drop in stock prices as reported by the news.
:::

-   Burberry is a luxury fashion house based in London. (Source: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burberry>)

-   Assuming "the drop in stock prices" refers to the recent period of 2023 and beyond, then the reason may be due to the decrease in higher-spending chinese consumers, which are play a large part in purchasing Burberry's goods.

-   As reported by the news, â€œThe problem clearly is China, which emerged from being a very small player in the luxury goods industry to becoming a massive presence over the last decade or so." (Source: <https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/23/luxury-stocks-slip-as-fears-grow-of-a-prolonged-downturn.html>)

### Part B

::: boxTask
What is an adequate ARMA model for the adjusted price? Produce a tsdiag for the chosen model with comment.
:::

<!-- ### A note on stationarity -->

<!-- *Note on stationarity:* Looking at the plots above, the data generating process for `bb2_adjusted` is likely non-stationary. This can be seen by the mean of the data varying across different time periods. Considering ARMA models taught by STAT456 are under the assumption that time series are stationary (Lecture Set 09 - AR Models, Slide 2), then ARMA models may not hold particularly well for this dataset as it currently is. Differencing the data may provide a better approximation of a stationary process.  -->

<!-- <!-- Nevertheless, for the purposes of this assignment `bb2_adjusted` will be analysed and modeled rather than `bb2_adjusted_diff`. -->

--\>

<!-- Running the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, it will be seen that `bb2_adjusted` has a p value of greater than $0.05$, and `bb2_adjusted_diff` has a p-value of less than $0.05$. This is further evidence that the differenced series may be stationary, while the non-differenced series is not. -->

<!-- ```{r} -->

<!-- library(tseries) -->

<!-- adf.test(bb2_adjusted) -->

<!-- adf.test(bb2_adjusted_diff) -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Nevertheless, the original (non-differenced) series `bb2_adjusted` will be investigated. This can be justified because a stationary model can be used to model a non-stationary process - it may just not necessarily be an accurate model. -->

To find an adequate ARMA model for the adjusted price, let's investigate the ACF and PACF plots to see what an appropriate model could be.

#### ACF/PACF

```{r}
acf(bb2_adjusted, lag.max = 100, main="ACF of BB2.BE adjusted data (daily)")
pacf(bb2_adjusted, lag.max = 100, main="PACF of BB2.BE adjusted data (daily)")
```

-   The ACF chart shows significant autocorrelations for all $\texttt{lag} < 100$, all of which are slowly tailing off. This may appear unusual, but could just be a sign that we modeling a non-stationary process. This may also indicate that there is no MA component/there is an AR component.

-   On the other hand, the PACF is significant in the first lag. This is likely a strong indication that there is an AR(1) component. There are some other sparsely distributed significant lags, e.g. $\texttt{lag} = 78$, however these are so far away from the start that it is very likely to just be noise.

Both of these facts suggests that an ARMA($1$,$0$) model is appropriate, i.e. the time series could be modeled as an AR($1$) process. Let's show the `summary()` and `tsdiag()` for the first 4 AR processes starting at 0 to confirm:

##### AR(0)

```{r}
model_ar0 <- arima(bb2_adjusted, order=c(0,0,0))
summary(model_ar0)
tsdiag(model_ar0)
```

The white noise (ARMA($0$,$0$)) process is clearly a bad fit. The residuals do not look like white noise, and the p-values in the Ljung-Box statistic are all below the $0.05$ level, showing that there is autocorrelation between the residuals.

##### AR(1)

```{r}
model_ar1 <- arima(bb2_adjusted, order=c(1,0,0))
summary(model_ar1)
tsdiag(model_ar1)
```

The AR($1$) model appears to be a decent fit:

(i) There are no clear ACFs above the line of significance (apart from the trivial lag $0$),
(ii) the standardized residuals approximately look like white noise, and
(iii) the p values for the Ljung-Box statistic are all above the line of significance, showing that we can fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is autocorrelation in the residuals. The AIC value is $2213.18$.

##### AR(2)

```{r}
model_ar2 <- arima(bb2_adjusted, order=c(2,0,0))
summary(model_ar2)
tsdiag(model_ar2)
```

All the comments for the above AR($1$) model apply. AR($2$) is a model of decent fit. The AIC is now a higher $2214.9$, which shows that AR($2$) may be slightly less optimal than AR($1$).

##### AR(3)

```{r}
model_ar3 <- arima(bb2_adjusted, order=c(3,0,0))
summary(model_ar3)
tsdiag(model_ar3)
```

As above, but the AIC is now $2216.33$. This increasing AIC may indicate that we are starting to overfit on the data.

##### Conclusion

Having run the above `summary` and `tsdiag`s of AR($0$) to AR($3$), it appears that ARMA($1$, $0$) = AR($1$) fits `bb2_adjusted` the best. The coefficients are **TODO**

#### auto.arima()

To confirm the above findings, let's see if auto.arima() gives the same result:

```{r}
model_auto <- auto.arima(bb2_adjusted, max.d=0) # d = 0 so it just tests ARMA instead of ARIMA
summary(model_auto)
tsdiag(model_auto)
```

Interestingly, auto.arima() returns an ARMA($0,5$) model (i.e. MA($5$)). This has a worse AIC ($5029.44$) than AR($1$), and the standardized residuals look far from white noise. This does not appear to be a good model. ARMA($1$, $0$) still appears to be the most 'adequate' model for this data.

## Part C

::: boxTask
Use the xts library to transoform the daily adjusted prices from the previous question to a monthly close series and plot it.
:::

```{r}
monthly_data <- xts::to.monthly(bb2_adjusted, OHLC=TRUE)
monthly_close <- monthly_data$bb2_adjusted.Close
plot(monthly_close, main="Monthly Close Prices of BB2.BE (Burberry Group)")
```

### Part D

::: boxTask
Identify a suitable ARMA model for the monthly close prices and verify its adequacy with `tsdiag`.
:::

As with the daily data, let's begin by analyzing the ACF and PACF.

#### ACF/PACF

```{r}
acf(monthly_close, main="ACF of Monthly Close Prices")
pacf(monthly_close, main="PACF of Monthly Close Prices")
```

-   Again, the ACF shows a high and slowly decreasing autocorrelation. This likely indicates an AR(p) process.

-   The PACF has a (very) significant first lag, as with the daily graph. This indicates an AR($1$) process, where the stock price one month ago can give information about the current stock price. There are also significant lags at lag $6$ and $13$. It is unclear whether these lags are very meaningful, given the data only spans 10 years. Nevertheless, these models can be investigated: AR(1), AR(6), and AR(13).

##### AR(1)

```{r}
model_month_ar1 <- arima(monthly_close, order=c(1,0,0))
summary(model_month_ar1)
tsdiag(model_month_ar1, gof.lag=13)
```

-   The standardized residuals plot does not appear like white noise. In particular, the variance appears small in the beginning of the plot compared to the end. Towards the end, there is also a clear negative bias in the residuals.

-   Most ACF of the residuals are within the lines of significance, with a couple of exceptions (lag $5$ and lag $12$). This is happening more than chance ($\frac{1}{20}$ given a p-value of $0.05$) which means this is likely not just noise.

-   All the p-values for the Ljung-Box statistic are above the line of significance. This means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are independently distributed. In other words, there is no significant evidence of autocorrelation in the residuals up to all the lags tested. Note that this result somewhat contradicts the observation on the standardized residuals.

-   The sole coefficient $\texttt{ar1}$ is $0.9193$. This shows that there is a correlation by the time series and itself (at $\texttt{lag}=1$) by this amount. This is very easy to intepret.

-   The AIC is $450.38$.

##### AR(6)

```{r}
model_month_ar6 <- arima(monthly_close, order=c(6,0,0))
summary(model_month_ar6)
tsdiag(model_month_ar6)
```

With the AR ($6$) model:

-   The standardized residuals look mostly the same,
-   The ACF is significant only for lag $12$.
-   The p-values are very high, which means we can fail to reject the hypothesis that the residuals are independently distributed.
-   The highest coefficient is the first one ($\texttt{ar1} = 0.9977$). Coefficients $\texttt{ar2}, \texttt{ar3},$ and $\texttt{ar4}$ are not significant (the coefficient value is contained within $2 \times \texttt{s.e.}$). Coefficient $\texttt{ar5}$ is $0.2912$ and significant, and coefficient $\texttt{ar6}$ is $-0.26$ as well as significant.

The AIC is lower, at $449.09$. Even though the AIC is lower, AR($1$) may still be the more sensible model because it is simpler (parsimony, as it has less autoregressive terms).

##### AR(13)

```{r}
model_month_ar13 <- arima(monthly_close, order=c(13,0,0))
summary(model_month_ar13)
tsdiag(model_month_ar13)
```

These results for the AR($13$) graphs look similar to the AR($6$) graphs only mildly improving them. The AIC is also worse than both AR($6$) and AR($1$), being at $457.56$ which suggests this model is not optimal compared to them.

Thus, the most sensible model is possibly AR($1$).

### Part E
